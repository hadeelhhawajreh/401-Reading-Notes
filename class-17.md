Web Scraping
Web scraping is a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website, which can save a huge amount of time and effort. In this article, we will go through an easy example of how to automate downloading hundreds of files from the New York MTA. This is a great exercise for web scraping beginners who are looking to understand how to web scrape. Web scraping can be slightly intimidating, so this tutorial will break down the process of how to go about the process.

Python Code
We start by importing the following libraries.
```
import requests
import urllib.request
import time
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```
Next, we set the url to the website and access the site with our requests library.
```
url = 'http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html'
response = requests.get(url)

```

Next we parse the html with BeautifulSoup so that we can work with a nicer, nested BeautifulSoup data structure. If you are interested in learning more about this library, check out the BeatifulSoup documentation.
```
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, “html.parser”)
```
We use the method .findAll to locate all of our <a> tags.
  
  ```
soup.findAll('a')
  ```
  
  
  
```
# Import libraries
import requests
import urllib.request
import time
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Set the URL you want to webscrape from
url = 'http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html'

# Connect to the URL
response = requests.get(url)

# Parse HTML and save to BeautifulSoup object¶
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")

# To download the whole data set, let's do a for loop through all a tags
line_count = 1 #variable to track what line you are on
for one_a_tag in soup.findAll('a'):  #'a' tags are for links
    if line_count >= 36: #code for text files starts at line 36
        link = one_a_tag['href']
        download_url = 'http://web.mta.info/developers/'+ link
        urllib.request.urlretrieve(download_url,'./'+link[link.find('/turnstile_')+1:]) 
        time.sleep(1) #pause the code for a sec
    #add 1 for next line
    line_count +=1
 ```
