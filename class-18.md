### Caesar cipher
 is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

 #### The transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets; the cipher alphabet is the plain alphabet rotated left or right by some number of positions. For instance, here is a Caesar cipher using a left rotation of three places, equivalent to a right shift of 23 (the shift parameter is used as the key):

 ```
Plain:    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Cipher:   XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW
```


*Cryptography, or the art and science of encrypting sensitive information, was once exclusive to the realms of government, academia, and the military. However, with recent technological advancements, cryptography has begun to permeate all facets of everyday life.*



**A Brief Word on Polymorphism
Before we continue, I want to touch on a more advanced topic known as polymorphism.**

While the intricacies of this topic stretch far beyond the realm of this guide, its increasing prevalence mandates that I include a brief explanation.

Polymorphism is basically a cipher that changes itself with each use. Meaning that each time it is used, it produces a different set of results. So, if you encrypted the exact same set of data twice, each new encryption would be different from the previous one.


##### Why Does Cryptography Matter?
For starters, let’s discuss the only real alternative to cryptography, obfuscation. Obfuscation is defined as “The act of making something unclear, obscure, or unintelligible”. It means that, in order to transmit a secure message, you must hold back some of the information required to understand the message.

####  Types of Cryptography
1. Hashing
2. Symmetric Cryptography

3. Asymmetric Cryptography
4. Key Exchange Algorithms


5. The 4 Types of Cryptographic Functions
So now that you understand a little bit more about the different types of cryptography, many of you are probably wondering how it is applied in the modern world.

There are four primary ways that cryptography is implemented in information security. These four applications are called “cryptographic functions”.

1. Authentication
2. Nonrepudiation
3. Confidentiality
With information leaks and a seemingly endless number of privacy scandals making the headlines, keeping your private information,, well, private is probably one of your biggest concerns. This is the exact function for which cryptographic systems were originally developed.  

With the right encryption tools, users can guard sensitive company data, personal medical records, or just lock their computer with a simple password.

4. Integrity
