## The pandas

The pandas package is the most important tool in the field of Data Scientists and Analysts working in Python today.

Pandas is a high-level data manipulation tool developed by Wes McKinney. It is built on the Numpy package meaning a lot of the structure of NumPy is used or replicated in Pandas. Data in pandas is often used to feed statistical analysis in SciPy, plotting functions from Matplotlib, and machine learning algorithms in Scikit-learn.

The primary two components of pandas are the Series and DataFrame. A Series is essentially a column, and a DataFrame is a multi-dimensional table made up of a collection of Series.
