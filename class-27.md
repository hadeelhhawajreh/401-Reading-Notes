## Readings: Django Models


*Django web applications access and manage data through Python objects referred to as models. Models define the structure of stored data, including the field types and possibly also their maximum size, default values, selection list options, help text for documentation, label text for forms, etc. The definition of the model is independent of the underlying database — you can choose one of several as part of your project settings. Once you've chosen what database you want to use, you don't need to talk to it directly at all — you just write your model structure and other code, and Django handles all the dirty work of communicating with the database for you.*


## Model primer

Models are usually defined in an application's models.py file. They are implemented as subclasses of`` django.db.models.Model``, and can include fields, 1. methods and 2. metadata.

The code fragment below shows a "typical" model, named MyModelName:

```python
from django.db import models

class MyModelName(models.Model):
    """A typical class defining a model, derived from the Model class."""

    # Fields
    my_field_name = models.CharField(max_length=20, help_text='Enter field documentation')
    ...

    # Metadata
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-my_field_name']

    # Methods
    def get_absolute_url(self):
        """Returns the url to access a particular instance of MyModelName."""
        return reverse('model-detail-view', args=[str(self.id)])

    def __str__(self):
        """String for representing the MyModelName object (in Admin site etc.)."""
        return self.my_field_name
        
```
## Django Admin

The Django admin application can use your models to automatically build a site area that you can use to create, view, update, and delete records. This can save you a lot of time during development, making it very easy to test your models and get a feel for whether you have the right data. The admin application can also be useful for managing data in production, depending on the type of website. The Django project recommends it only for internal data management (i.e. just for use by admins, or people internal to your organization), as the model-centric approach is not necessarily the best possible interface for all users, and exposes a lot of unnecessary detail about the models. 



in ``admin.py ``in the catalog application`` (/locallibrary/catalog/admin.py)``. It currently looks like this — note that it already imports`` django.contrib.admin``:
``` python
from django.contrib import admin

# Register your models here.
```



Register the models by copying the following text into the bottom of the file. This code imports the models and then calls admin.site.register to register each of them.
``` python
from .models import Author, Genre, Book, BookInstance

admin.site.register(Book)
admin.site.register(Author)
admin.site.register(Genre)
admin.site.register(BookInstance)
```

### Creating a superuser
In order to log into the admin site, we need a user account with Staff status enabled. In order to view and create records we also need this user to have permissions to manage all our objects.  You can create a "superuser" account that has full access to the site and all needed permissions using manage.py.

Call the following command, in the same directory as manage.py, to create the superuser. You will be prompted to enter a username, email address, and strong password.
``` python
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
